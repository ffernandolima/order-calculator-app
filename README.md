# Order Calculator App

Order Calculator App is a console application (command line application) which has been developed in order to solve an existent problem related to calculate the total price of an order based on some arguments that must be provided by the consumer. The consumer must provide at least 4 arguments (operation, catalog file path, product and product quantity), so that the application will be able to perform some calculations and return a result. An important thing to call attention is, a csv file or a txt file following a pattern (data separated by commas) will be used as a database to allow the application gets relevant data and performs the calculations. There's an instruction file explaning how this application works, so for getting further information, please read this file.
